# Build-a-Knave

www.cjkg.github.io/knave-generator

This was built as a project to better understand React. However, I also believe it to be the fullest and most accurate Knave character generator out there.

The main improvements it has on its rivals is that it generates Age, Alignment, and Max Henchmen (a stat buried in the rulesheet!).

Further it does not reduce the items the player receives if they don't have enough item slots. This allows the player to decide what they want to keep and what they want to discard, rather than doing it for them.

Finally, it does not generate copper pennies for the player. This is because the player receives an allowance of copper pennies only if they are going to pick out their equipment non-randomly. So, I left that out as well.
